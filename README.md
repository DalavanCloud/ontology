# TDWG Ontology

TDWG has an ontology that consists of a series of RDF and OWL files with associated documentation.

These files are used to define exchange and understanding of biodiversity data.

Their original home and namespace is at http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/Ontology.owl

See the [recommended replacements page](replacements.md) for recommended alternatives to deprecated portions of the ontology.
