# TDWG Ontology

TDWG has a series of RDF and OWL ontology documents with associated documentation. The ontologies described by these documents are known in aggregate as the "TDWG Ontology". They are archived in this repository.

These ontologies are used to define exchange and understanding of biodiversity data. Their original home was at [http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/Ontology.owl](http://rs.tdwg.org/ontology/voc/Ontology.owl). For background on the history of the ontology see Section 2.4 of the [Report of the TDWG Vocabulary Management Task Group (VoMaG)](https://github.com/tdwg/vocab/blob/master/gbif_TDWG_Vocabulary_Management_Task_Group_en_v1.0.pdf); Permanent URL: [http://www.gbif.org/resource/80862](http://www.gbif.org/resource/80862). 

The TDWG Ontology is no longer under development.  Parts of the ontology were never widely used and have been deprecated. See the [recommended replacements page](replacements.md) for recommended alternatives to deprecated portions of the ontology. 

Section 2.6.1 of the [VoMaG report)](https://github.com/tdwg/vocab/blob/master/gbif_TDWG_Vocabulary_Management_Task_Group_en_v1.0.pdf) contains a series of recommendations regarding the fate of the various TDWG ontologies. Those recommendations have been implemented and are summarized as follows:

1. Clarify that documents having the extension .owl (TaxonConcept.owl, TaxonName.owl, and TaxonRank.owl) are not the authoritative documents by indicating in their RDF that they are deprecated and replaced by the corresponding documents having the extension .rdf (TaxonConcept.rdf, TaxonName.rdf, and TaxonRank.rdf). (Recommendation 2.4)
